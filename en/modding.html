                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">In a certain game, you can play several different predefined characters. What if we change one of them?</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">So he redid all the "Sprites" of a character in the game, and aligned them correctly, changed lines of code so that his name would be different in the game and the animations would work well. He also changed some sound effects specific to the character.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Said game is "Spelunky 2".</p>

                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">In another game, there were several pieces of music that he wanted to integrate.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">So he learned to code with the language the game uses to add custom music. He modified these tunes to make them loop perfectly and repeat without shocking transitions.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Said game is "Don't Starve Together".</p>
