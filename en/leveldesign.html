                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Bastien has created several mini-games, mostly for the game "Team Fortress 2" but not only.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Here is one of the mini-games he created for "Team Fortress 2", this mini-game consists of placing the players on the square squares on the ground. These squares are destroyed randomly. The players who fell down are then moved on platforms of various mini-games that they must complete in order to get back to the main platform.</p>

                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Decorating in a map/level design is very important. The functionality of a level is necessary but the decoration makes it nice.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">So he "mapped" several of these levels, here is one of his renderings, a dense jungle in which you have to navigate with parkour.</p>
