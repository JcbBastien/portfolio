                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Here is one of Bastien's projects, a Chinese portrait.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">For this project, Bastien had to create a website that had to represent a portrait of himself in the form of a comparison. He had to ask himself the question "if I were a [...]" and answer it as well as to add a reasoning to it.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">He also had to add an additional section allowing users to add their own sections to the site.</p>

                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Here's another such project created with fellow students Hugo Lecerf and Vincent Gilbert.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">This project consisted in creating a data visualization site based on an API, data data put into a Json table to be collected and visualized on the site.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">For this project, he was mainly responsible for the Javascript part. Together with his classmates, he enriched the database by adding information found on the Internet.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">The visual side of the site was designed and created by his colleague Vincent Gilbert.</p>

                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">This project is another rather special one that he carried out as part of a group to create a fictitious communications agency for an exhibition on the theme of colors.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">In this project, Bastien was in charge of the entire VR part of the site, so he created 3D models, learned to use the Three.js library and put it all together to create a unique experience open to interpretation.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">The site is no longer online, but you can view the video presentation below.</p>
