                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">For this project, Bastien had to create a website that had to represent a portrait of himself in the form of a comparison. He had to ask himself the question "if I were a [...]" and answer it as well as to add a reasoning to it.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">He also had to add an additional section allowing users to add their own sections to the site.</p>

                <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">Here is another one of those projects that was created with fellow student Killian G.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">This project consisted of creating a data visualization site from an API, data put into a Json table and to be collected and visualized on the site.</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">For this project, he used the d3 library to facilitate the production of his code. But he is still not entirely satisfied with his code, he says; "If it were possible to continue working on it, I would transform several lines into a function to reduce the code considerably".</p>
                    <p class="pixel sharpshadowtxtsmall">The visual part of the site was thought and realized by his friend Killian.</p>
